GEN_QUIZ â€“ Phase 5: Optimize (Result)

Date: 2025-10-31

Targets
- Concurrency: parallel create/submit without timeouts; stable behavior for guest user.
- Latency: soft budget for create/get under typical dev env; no strict SLA enforced.
- Data integrity: question order stable; quiz content unchanged after submit.

Current status
- Verified basic ordering and immutability in unit tests; to extend in integration set when reaching 42 cases.
- No JWT; focus on guest flows and repository operations.
