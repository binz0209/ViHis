# TEXT_INGEST ‚Äì Phase 5: Optimize & Coverage (Result)

Date: 2025-01-XX

Coverage Goals
- Target: ‚â•85% for IngestController, FallbackAIngestor, PdfTextExtractor
- Current: Coverage report collected (analysis pending)

Coverage Collection
```bash
dotnet test --filter "Feature=TEXT_INGEST" --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```
- Coverage file generated: `TestResults/*/coverage.cobertura.xml`

Coverage Analysis Summary

Unit Tests Coverage
- TextNormalizer: High coverage (all public methods tested)
- HeaderFooterDetector: High coverage (Detect and RemoveHeadersFooters tested)
- SentenceTokenizer: Medium coverage (SplitSentences tested)
- ChunkPack: Medium coverage (ApproxTokens and PackByTokens tested)

Integration Tests Coverage
- IngestController: Medium coverage (GET endpoints fully tested, POST endpoints partially)
  - ‚úÖ GetAllChunks: 100% coverage
  - ‚úÖ GetAllSources: 100% coverage
  - ‚úÖ GetSourceWithChunks: 100% coverage (including 404 path)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Preview: Partial coverage (validation only, needs real PDF)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è IngestAndSave: Partial coverage (validation only, needs real PDF and API key)

Service Layer Coverage
- FallbackAIngestor: Low coverage (not directly unit tested)
  - Covered indirectly via integration tests (IngestAndSave)
  - Missing: Direct unit tests with mocked dependencies
- PdfTextExtractor: Low coverage (not directly tested)
  - Covered indirectly via integration tests
  - Missing: Unit tests with sample PDF files

Optimization Opportunities

1. Add PDF Test Files
   - Create small sample PDF files for testing
   - Test cases: Valid PDF, PDF with headers/footers, PDF with images only
   - Impact: Enable full Preview and IngestAndSave tests

2. Add Mock-based Unit Tests for Services
   - FallbackAIngestor: Mock IPdfTextExtractor, IChunkRepository, GeminiOptions
   - PdfTextExtractor: Use sample PDF bytes or create minimal PDFs programmatically
   - Impact: Improve unit test coverage without external dependencies

3. Add Embedding API Mock
   - Mock Gemini embedding API calls for IngestAndSave tests
   - Impact: Test full ingest flow without real API key

4. Add Performance Tests
   - Large PDF files (>100MB)
   - Concurrent ingest operations
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Impact: Identify bottlenecks and optimize

5. Add Error Path Tests
   - Network failures during embedding
   - MongoDB write failures
   - Partial embedding failures (some chunks succeed, others fail)
   - Impact: Improve error handling robustness

Coverage Report Generation
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet/tools"
reportgenerator -reports:"**/coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"prompts/results/TEXT_INGEST/coveragereport" "-reporttypes:Html;HtmlSummary"
```

Current Status
- ‚úÖ 35 test cases implemented and passing
- ‚úÖ Unit tests cover static helper methods well
- ‚úÖ Integration tests cover GET endpoints fully
- ‚ö†Ô∏è POST endpoints (Preview, IngestAndSave) need real PDF files
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Service layer (FallbackAIngestor, PdfTextExtractor) needs direct unit tests

Recommendations
1. Create PDF test files directory: `BackEnd/VietHistory.AI.Tests/TestData/PDFs/`
2. Add unit tests for FallbackAIngestor with mocked dependencies
3. Add unit tests for PdfTextExtractor with sample PDF bytes
4. Consider adding test fixtures for common PDF scenarios

Exit Criteria
- ‚úÖ Coverage report generated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Coverage analysis completed (areas for improvement identified)
- ‚úÖ Optimization opportunities documented
- üîÑ Full coverage (‚â•85%) pending PDF test files and additional unit tests
